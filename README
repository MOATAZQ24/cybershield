# CyberShield Project Overview & File Descriptions

## Project Overview

**CyberShield** is a web-based interactive simulation platform designed to demonstrate and educate about **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack detection and mitigation**. It provides a practical, visual environment where users can simulate various DDoS attack types, observe real-time network traffic, and visualize attack detection using a simplified, rule-based machine learning approach. The project aims to make complex cybersecurity threats understandable through hands-on, visual simulation.

**What the project DOES:**
- Simulates various DDoS attack types (SYN Flood, UDP Flood, HTTP Flood)
- Displays real-time network traffic and metrics
- Demonstrates a simplified, rule-based machine learning detection mechanism
- Provides an interactive web interface for controlling simulations and viewing results
- Offers a full-stack web application experience (frontend and backend)
- Is suitable as an educational tool and a graduation project

**What the project DOES NOT do (current version):**
- Does not use complex, real-world trained machine learning models
- Does not integrate with real network traffic or live systems
- Does not perform actual mitigation actions on a network
- Does not include advanced cybersecurity tools like Wireshark or Nmap

**Frameworks Used:**
- **Frontend**: React (with Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Recharts)
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **API**: RESTful APIs

**Setup:**
The project can be set up using the `run_cybershield.sh` script or through manual installation.
